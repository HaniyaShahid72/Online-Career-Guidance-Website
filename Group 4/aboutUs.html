Over the years, we have refined the product which, together with the enviable results we have achieved, ensures that high school learners and students will follow a career path that is best suited to their particular career orientation.   Helping to make informed, realistic choices to get a head start in life.  The evaluation takes approximately 45 minutes and on completion, generates a comprehensive report on suitable career options and the required tertiary qualification for each career option.  Of singular importance, the report also details the recommended subjects that should be pursued during the FET stage of high school, for grade 10, 11 and 12.</p>
